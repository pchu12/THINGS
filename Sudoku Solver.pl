
% Explanation for Program
% The program asks the user for a sudoku puzzle to solve
% The program will convert the userâ€™s input into cell and add them a list: Board

% The cell (cell(Value, Notes, Col-Row, Square)) is made up of a few parts

% the 'final' Value of the cell
  % if the cell does not have an inputed value it will be initialized to 0
  % the Value can temporarily change to search for the solution in the run_Possibilities function

% Notes hold all the possible Values for a cell
  % if the cell has a Value (non-Zero) the cells Notes will be equal to the Value
      % cells with a Value equal to Zero- the Notes will be initialized to 0 but will be changed in findNotes
  % Notes can be changed in findNotes based on the Value of the the cells in the same Square/Row/Column

% Col-Row, Square is the location of the cell

% at any point in the next part of the process the board is solved it will end the program

% After the list is created it will create a Notes list for each cell
% then it will try to solve the puzzle by finding cells with only one member in the Notes list and
% changing its Value then creating new Notes lists for every cell and repeating the process again

% Sudoku puzzles on the easier side can be solved this way but for more complicated boards it will move to the next step
% it will find the shortest Notes list and guess a Value from the Notes list to be its new Value and
% create new Notes lists from that repeating the process from before
  % if the value seems to be right it will guess another Value repeating the process
      % if all possible Values from the are used it will return and change the Value the previous cell changed
  % if the Value seems to wrong it will change the Value of the cell to the next member of the Notes list
